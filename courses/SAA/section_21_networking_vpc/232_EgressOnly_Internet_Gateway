EgressOnly_Internet_Gateway
only internet gateway for IPv6 only
similiar as NAT but NAT is for IPv4

IPv6 are all public ip address
so ipv6 insatnces are puclic accessable

but if add EgressOnly_Internet_Gateway into route table
then ipv6 insatnce can only send request to internet, external cannot access ipv6 instance
