1 can not ssh to ec2 instance in private subnet

first ssh to ec2 instance in public subnet, then ssh to ec2 instance in private subnet 
need bastion host or jump box in public subnet as proxy

add default sg (allow all traffic through the sg itself) to ec2 isntances in publich and private subnets
so that ec2 in a vpc can connect with each other with ping

but why? why my labtop can not directly ssh ec2 in private subnet
